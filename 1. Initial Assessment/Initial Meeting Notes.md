# Company Overview Notes

Better Purchase is a physical and online retail chain that has been in business for over 40 years.  Management of the physical stores is siloed from the online business, and has lagged behind in using technology as a driver for operations.  Seen as a shrinking business unit, management of physical stores has faced internal political headwinds when asking for resources - and is looking to technology solutions to help reduce costs and increase profitability.

Lacking in internal expertise managment is hiring a consultancy to design a solution.

## Business objectives and pain points

- Current reporting is entirely manual.  
  - A small team of financial analysts manually pull together data from various systems and create reports each month in Excel.
- There is a lack of data driven decision making  
  - The effort needed to manually generate these reports means there isn't much time for exploratory analysis or decision support as most of their time is spent refreshing standard reports.
  - Management would like reporting that allows for more detailed insight around product mixes that perform well and give inventory reccomendations.
  - Reccomendations should be tailored to each retail location - and allow for seasonality / holiday adjustments 
- Campaign performance is unclear
  - Today promotional efforts are performed largely blind - selecting as many people as they can afford within their budget.  Management would like a data solution that reccomends who should be targeted in a given promotion. 
  - Management needs ROI reporting on promotional campaign efforts, with the ability to look across campaigns to see overall ROI across various product and demographic groupings. 
  
## Support requirements & internal customers

- Reporting does not need to be real-time. Daily updates are sufficient.
- Reporting needs to be accessable to a team of 4 analysts and management views available to another 3 individuals in various levels of managment.  
- If sucessful the number of users and business units that will be looking to take advantage of new data solutions is likely to increase, but not to more than 75 users.

## Resources 

Being an under-performing business unit, management would like to minimize overhead initially until they are convinced there is a return on this investment.  They would like reporting to be maintained by their existing analytics staff, and are willing to staff up to two full-time data support staff roles.  Total annual costs to maintain this new solution cannot initially exceed more than $300k in increased salary and technology support fees.
