## Data Models

Managment would like two models to be created as a part of this effort.

### Predicted Customer Response 
Returns the probability that a customer will respond to a given planned promotion.  Features might include demographic information, customer past shopping activity, campaign timing etc.

### Customer Groupings
Group similar customers based on demographic and historical transaction data.  Can be used to returns a ranking of products that a given customer is most like to purchase based on top selling products to similar customers etc.

Given where the customer is today, I recommend we stage these modeling projects as secondary objectives to be scoped in their entirety only after the foundational data archetecture and reporting has been implemented.  I caution the client to no attempt to run before we've learned to walk.
