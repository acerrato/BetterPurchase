With secure app-based Bluetooth setup, there is no need to connect a TV or monitor for setup or viewing (optional). You can easily configure your system right from the app on your smartphone or tablet with the Bluetooth connection. While a TV or monitor is not required, with Google Assistant you can use simple voice commands to stream camera footage directly to your TV or monitor, all while remaining hands free. Each camera has 2-Way audio (talk and listen) as well as a built-in siren and preset voice alerts. From within the app, you can easily activate the built-in siren, startling intruders and sending them packing. Have a guest but can&#8217;t get to them? Use a preset voice alert to let them know! Smart detection technology including human detection, facial capture, and vehicle alerts reduce the risk of false alarms, keeping you safe and well protected. Facial capture lets you see who is on your property by snapping a photo and sending the image to your Smart Device. Motion-activated dual spotlights flood your yard with bright lights when human motion is detected, instantly warding off trespassers. Proudly designed and engineered in the USA, our security system uses a built-in wireless connection for uninterrupted viewing with no delays. Our app gives you control of your system and easy access to your recordings, regardless of where you are. Night Owl never charges fees for storage or access to your videos. All recordings are securely stored on a pre-installed hard drive for convenience. You can view and download the recordings as you need them. This system provides the latest technology to give you the ultimate security experience.
